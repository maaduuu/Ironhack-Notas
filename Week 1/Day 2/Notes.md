> Perceivability

**Videos should have subtitles, and pictures should include descriptive alt text so speech software can give the user an accurate idea of their contents, another perceivability requirement is including enough contrast between colors, in order to allow people with visual difficulties to still understand the included information.**

> Operability

**Good websites and web apps should be accessible using only a keyboard. This means that, for example, there canâ€™t be any blocking elements that require the use of a mouse.**

> Understandability

**Some important guidelines here are the following:**
* Texts have to be readable and easily understandable.
* Websites need to operate in a predictable manner.
* Input fields have to offer assistance to users.
